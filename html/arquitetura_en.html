        <h1>New Castelão</h1>

        <p>In two years of work, the arena and surroundings were transformed, including a 55,000 m² access plaza and a covered parking lot with capacity for around 2,000 vehicles,
            in addition to service infrastructure and buildings to house state agencies. The main access façade was made with a glass skin structure and follows the curvature of the
            stadium, which avoids internal heating, as the technology does not absorb the sun's rays. The result will provide greater thermal comfort to the public and a reduction in energy consumption.
            energy in the use of air conditioning</p>

        <p>The stadium holds up to 67,000 people and draws attention to its 36,000 m² roof, which is made up of metal tiles. At its inner end, it has a compound ring
                by polycarbonate or translucent tiles, to avoid shading in stretches of the lawn caused by the sun's position, which is detrimental to the quality of the television transmission. the coverage
                it was also prepared to receive photovoltaic energy panels, helping to capture solar energy.
                m da reforma do estádio, também foi construído o Cine Clube Arena Castelão, uma sala de cinema com capacidade para 150 lugares e com uma tela de 7 m de largura por 4 m de altura. 
                O cinema terá entrada gratuita, abrindo apenas aos sábados e com uma única sessão às 18h. O objetivo: oferecer uma programação educativa e cultural relacionada ao esporte.</p>
        
            <p>Outra iniciativa, o Espaço Cultural Deputado Etevaldo Nogueira, é dividido em quatro temáticas: História do Futebol Cearense, Grandes Clássicos, Personalidades e Arena Castelão. 
                O local conta com dois miniauditórios que recebem até 30 pessoas, onde serão apresentados depoimentos de personalidades importantes como jogadores, historiadores e árbitros.
        
                Concluindo os novos espaços, também foi desenvolvido o Top Moda Castelão, um centro de compras que disponibilizará 58 lojas na parte interna do estádio para empresários do setor de moda 
                nos segmentos de confecções, calçados e acessórios.</p>
                The lawn was 30 meters closer to the lower chairs. People with special disabilities have 2.5% of the seats (1,675 seats), 1% more than required by
                rules of the Ministry of Sport. All seats are covered and have V0 (V zero) and UV protection, preventing the spread of flames and being more resistant to impacts.</p>

        <h3>Sustainable construction Arena Fortaleza</h3>
        <p>The work, in compliance with FIFA requirements, followed the sustainable construction model and several measures were taken in the search for LEED certification (Leadership in Energy and
            Environmental Design), green seal for buildings. Among the actions taken is the recycling of all the concrete from the demolitions, transformed into paving material.
            from the parking lot. A vacuum sewage system was also adopted, allowing for a 90% reduction in water consumption and also in the demand for the city's sanitary sewage system.
            
            High energy efficiency air conditioning systems, using chillers for water cooling and VRF systems, were adopted in the stadium. The lighting project was
            developed to minimize energy consumption, using as much natural light as possible, dividing circuits and adopting automatic control. To complete the measures, there is the
            reuse of rainwater and installation of generators for essential loads, using engines powered by natural gas.</p>

        <h3>Additional Infrastructure</h3>
        <p>In addition to the renovation of the stadium, the Cine Clube Arena Castelão was also built, a cinema room with capacity for 150 seats and with a screen 7 m wide by 4 m high.
